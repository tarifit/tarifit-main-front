# Tarifit Auth Service Frontend

## Issue Resolution

If you're not seeing the dictionary, navbar, or modals, here are the steps to fix it:

### 1. Platform Dependencies Issue
The main issue is likely the esbuild platform mismatch. To fix this:

```bash
# Remove problematic node_modules
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall for correct platform
npm install
```

If this fails due to file permission issues in WSL, try:
```bash
# Force clean and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
npm install --force
```

### 2. Current Application Structure

The app has been updated with:

#### âœ… Components Created:
- **Navbar Component**: Full Tayrawt-style navigation with glassmorphism
- **Dictionary Component**: Functional search with 3 search modes (Semantic, Exact, Fuzzy)
- **UI Kit Showcase**: Interactive component gallery
- **Auth Modals**: Login/Register with proper styling

#### âœ… Features Added:
- FontAwesome icons support
- Full Tamawalt UI Kit CSS classes
- Responsive design
- Interactive search with dialect filtering
- Mock Tarifit dictionary data

### 3. Navigation

Currently set up as:
- **Default section**: `'dictionaries'` 
- **Brand click**: Goes to Dictionary
- **Navigation**: Dictionary, Translation, Conjugation (last two are placeholders)
- **Test buttons**: For accessing auth modals

### 4. What You Should See

When the app loads correctly, you should see:
1. **Title**: "ðŸŒŸ Tarifit Dictionary & UI Kit"
2. **Navigation buttons**: Dictionary, UI Kit, Test Modals
3. **Navbar**: Fixed top navigation with Tifinagh symbol
4. **Dictionary**: Search interface with dialect toggles
5. **Auth modals**: Working login/register when clicking buttons

### 5. Debugging

The app includes a debug indicator showing the current active section. If you see this but no content, check:
- Browser console for JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed CSS/resource loading
- Try clicking the different navigation buttons

### 6. Development Server

To start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

If the server fails to start due to the esbuild issue, the dependencies need to be reinstalled for the correct platform first.
